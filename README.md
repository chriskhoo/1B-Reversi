# 1B-Reversi project
====================
The game
--------
[REVERSI : Return of the dark side][14]


User story
----------
Reversi is a classic board game for 2. Reversi is traditionally played with black and white pieces that represent the dark and the light, the good and the bad, or in this case the dark side and the Jedi.

In Reversi, the board position can change significantly each turn. Reversi is known as Othello, as marketed by Mattel.

The board consists of 64 squares, 8x8. The starting position is 4 pieces at the center of the board, 2 white and 2 black, positioned diagonally opposite each other.

To move, the player must flank one or more opponent's pieces in the same horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The flanked pieces will be turned over, aka flipped, making them the player's. The pieces can only be played on empty squares.

The game is over when the boarded is filled or if there are no legal moves left. The player with the most pieces of his colour wins.

Design
------
This game was final of 3 game projects put together following the first 2 week of programming at GA's WDI course. In this project, my goal was to practice the development of game logic and to practice using OOP. Due to these design parameters, I used no external references to reversi programming logic - i.e. the code might not be the simplest nor most efficient.
